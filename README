Plzimg is a very simple and lightweight web application, without any
database, that lets users upload their images. It is developed in python3
and uses the Flask framework.

It doesn't provide any way to search for uploaded images, or even to list
them.  It is not possible to remove, tag or describe the images.  Just
upload the image, use the URL somewhere, do not lose it, and that’s it.


================
    Install
================
You need python3-flask and python3-pillow (to resize the uploaded images).
Simply create two directories, one for each size of image:
o/ for the original images
s/ for the resized images

You can test the application by running

$ python3 app.py

This will start a test server running on port 5000, but it is not suitable
for production.
If you want to deploy it on your web server, please refer to one of the
methods described on http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/deploying/

Here is, as an example, my own configuration, using uwsgi and nginx.  As an
additional feature, it provides compatibility with the URLs of the pix
software that can be found at http://pix.toile-libre.org/
It requires an additional directory, m/, that is filled with the smallest
images (used for the thumbs).

$ cat /etc/uwsgi.d/pix.ini
[uwsgi]
socket = 127.0.0.1:3032
master = true
plugin = python3
chdir = /home/louiz/plzimg
module = app:app
processes = 4

$ cat /etc/nginx/sites/pix.louiz.org.conf
server
{
        listen          80;
        server_name     pix.louiz.org;
        client_max_body_size 100m;

        location @pix {
            include        uwsgi_params;
            uwsgi_pass     127.0.0.1:3032;
        }

        location / {

            # Compatibility with pix.toile-libre.org URLs
            rewrite ^/upload/original/(.*)$ /o/$1 permanent;
            rewrite ^/upload/img/(.*)$ /s/$1 permanent;
            rewrite ^/upload/thumb/(.*)$ /m/$1 permanent;
            rewrite ^/\?img=(.*)$ /$1 permanent;

            root /home/louiz/plzimg/;

            try_files   $uri @pix;
        }
}
